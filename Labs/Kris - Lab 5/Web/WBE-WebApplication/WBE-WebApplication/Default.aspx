    <h2>
        Welcome to We bake &#39;em!</h2>
    <br />
    Do we have anything to put on this page, or should we get rid of it?
    <br />
    <br />
    I think we should put the WBE company page here and have links or buttons
    <br />
    that a user can select to navigate to their area of need; driver, customer, 
    owner,etc.<br />
    In other words, the company switchboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; -- kb
